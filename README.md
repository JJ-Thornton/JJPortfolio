# JJPortfolio
Code for Portfolio Site.

Full website built from the ground up, using HTML and CSS. This site aims to showcase the real capabilities of CSS, using animations, webkits, and cards to add depth and demension to the project. 

In the code intself you will find comments throughout that explain what each secction is doing. poking around through similar sites I found I was able to use less CSS to do more.

While this site is a portfolio, it is equally a passion project and reflects the things that I like. In the projects section you can see full, multi-page sites that I have made for clients organizations and businesses using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/React along with programs made using C++, C#, and Python.
